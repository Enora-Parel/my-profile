        <h2>Reading üìö</h2>
        <p>
            Listening to my parents, I've started to read since I put my eyes on a book... But I was too young to remember! I've always been passionated about stories. I read very different styles, from fantasy to cultural ones, but no horror in my to-read stack! It allows me to relax and I can live plenty of adventures while staying in bed... Reading has various benefits such as the mental stimulation, the stress reduction (reading can reduce stress by more than 65% in 6 minutes), the vocabulary expansion and the memory improvement. So I strongly encourage you to read at least 30 minutes per day as studies showed that it may increase your life expectancy by 2 years!

        <h2>Travelling üó∫</h2>
        <p>
            I didn't travel to many foreign countries in my life, but I'd love to ! I've already been to the United-States, Canada, Spain, Italy and England. I would love to visit the asian part of the world as well as Australia and New-Zealand.
            While travelling, I've met different people with different backgrounds and it allowed me to be very open-minded towards the people I live and deal with every day. Thanks to this, I learnt to be responsible and I'm not afraid to try new things and live new experiences.

          <h2>Associations ü§ù</h2>
          <p>
            I've been part of several different associations but they are all related, directly or indirectly, to humanitarian aid and solidarity. At Essec, I'm part of the SARI Association to help India and Nepal populations, I'm in charge with other people to build partnership with NGOs, to look for new sponsors and to organize projects to raise funds. I'm also a member of Cheer Up, an association for young adults with cancer. Finally I'm the president of the IES Association, we visit children in the pediatric department at the hospital. I'm responsible for the coordination of the IES departments, the organization of recruitments and events on the ESSEC campus, and we conduct interviews with candidates applying to the association. 
            And beside the Essec associations, I've also been a member of the Scouts and Guides of France for 11 years, and I participated in activities for Le Rocher, an association that organizes animations for children in sensible areas of France.
